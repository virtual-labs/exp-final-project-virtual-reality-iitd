# Theory 

## Pre-Production: Preparing for the Project

### Define the Concept and Storyboard
- Decide the message of your commercial (e.g., durable, military-grade, rugged, premium).
- Sketch a storyboard outlining the scenes, key moments, and transitions.

### Gather References
- Collect images of military-grade water bottles for inspiration (materials, shapes, textures).
- Study lighting setups from similar commercials for desired moods.

### Set Up Your Workspace
- Ensure your VR system and Gravity Sketch software are installed and updated.
- Configure a clear, safe area for VR use.

### Prepare Assets
- Gather any additional elements needed (e.g., logos, brand colors).
- Plan the final resolution and format for rendering.

## Production: Creating the Mockup in Gravity Sketch

### 1. Modeling the Military-Grade Water Bottle

#### Launch Gravity Sketch
- Open Gravity Sketch in VR and select the "New Scene" option.

#### Set Up Workspace
- Import a reference image of a military-grade water bottle as a canvas.
- Scale and position the canvas for easy reference.

#### Create the Base Shape
- Use the "Revolve Tool" to create the bottle's body:
  - Draw half the bottle’s profile (side view).
  - Revolve the curve around its central axis to form a 3D object.
- Use the “Edit Points” feature to adjust the shape.

#### Add Details
- Use the "Stroke Tool" or "Surface Tool" to add grooves, caps, or embossed logos.
- Smooth transitions and sharp edges as needed.

### 2. Texturing the Bottle

#### Apply Base Material
- Use the “Material Editor” to assign a basic material (e.g., matte, glossy, or metallic).

#### Custom Textures
- Import textures (e.g., branding labels) as PNG files.
- Place and wrap textures onto the bottle using the "Decal Tool."

#### Fine-Tune Colors
- Use the "Color Picker" to refine material colors, transparency, or reflectivity.

### 3. Setting Up Camera Angles

#### Position the Camera
- Use the "Camera Tool" to set up dynamic angles (e.g., close-ups, wide shots).
- Experiment with perspectives to enhance the bottle's visual appeal.

#### Plan Transitions
- Sketch camera paths if you intend to create animations later.

### 4. Lighting

#### Add Key Lighting
- Use a "Directional Light" to simulate natural or studio light.
- Position the key light to highlight the bottle's contours.

#### Fill and Back Lighting
- Add "Fill Lights" to soften shadows.
- Add a "Back Light" for a rim effect to separate the bottle from the background.

#### HDRI Environments
- Import HDRI maps for realistic reflections and environment lighting.

### 5. Rendering

#### Render Settings
- Choose the desired resolution and output format (e.g., PNG sequence, MP4).
- Enable high-quality options like anti-aliasing and ray tracing.

#### Preview the Scene
- Use the “Preview Render” feature to check lighting, materials, and camera angles.

#### Render the Final Output
- Start rendering and export the final visuals.

## Post-Production (Optional)

### Edit the Footage
- Import rendered frames into video editing software (e.g., Premiere Pro or After Effects).
- Add background music, voiceovers, or text overlays.

### Add Final Touches
- Adjust color grading to match the brand's aesthetic.
- Include motion graphics or transitions if needed.
